<h1>Reasons why I should get a credit card!</h1>
<p>2 Dear Mom and Dad, 
	As you may know I am now going into 7th grade and I now believe that I am old enough and responsible enough to own a credit card.
There are many good qualities and bad qualities to my request, but mostly good. For example I can buy stuff for you instead of you
going to the store, use the card in emergency shopping situations, and the best part is that when I use this card I will be using my
own money. 
	I know that there are safety questions about me having this opportunity, like identity theft, and me losing the card, but I think 
That I have shown  you guys that I can keep things for long periods of time without losing things. Having a credit card would give me
the availability of buying things when I need them. For example, when I go to the mall, It is somettimes difficult to wait for mom to 
pay for what I would like to buy
