<h1>At GEMS I learned how to be a mechanical engineer!</h1>

<p>
We worked in groups of two to build towers made of newspaper with limited resources the towers had to be as tall as possible and hold a mini-disco ball lip gloss container at the top. We had two rounds, in the first round we built a tower that used two columns on each level. The secon d time we used three colomns per level.
