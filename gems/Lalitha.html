<h1>Something cool I learned at GEMS!</h1>

<p>
I learned how to make lip balm with honey, shortening, kool-aid, and hot water. You first take 3 spoons of honey and 2 spoons of vegetable shortening and mix that together, After it iswell mixed, split it into two bowls. After that, mix 1 pack of Kool-Aid and 2 milliliters of hot water. Then, with a dropper, drop the wet mixture into the shortening mixture and mix well. Put it in a container and be prepared to have awesome lips.
