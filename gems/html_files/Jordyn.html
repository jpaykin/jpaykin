<h1>Material Science and Engineering</h1>

<p>
  During PennGEMS, we had the oppurtunity to learn more about material science and engineering. In this class we learned about materials such as plastics and ceramics. The first activity we did was experimenting with shrinky dinks. Shrinky Dinks are a stretched out piece of plastic and when you put the shrinky dink in the oven, it is smaller. We got to decorate and color our own shrinky dink and then later turn it into a keychain later. The second activity we did was make our own lip gloss. We used 1 tablespoon of honey, a red Kool-Aid packet,and 2 tablespoons of shortning.We mixed the ingredients together and eventually made a pinky-red lipgloss. In conclusion I had a very fun time doing material science.
