<h1>Something cool I learned at GEMS!</h1>
<p>
At Gems I learned about multiple types of engineering. I learned about how when plastic gets hot it shrinks because of the material in it called "polymer." I thought it was very interesting for something to reduce to 1/3 of it size becasue of heat and what its made of. Another thing we did was bioengeneering. We tested eachothers reflexes and our reaction time with a goniometer. It was really fun! We put three adhesives pads on our knees, that had a metal applicator on it. We applied wires to it. Those wires hooked up to a machine that was linked to the computer monitor. The monitor showed the wiggly lines that you typically see on a screen by someone's hopital bed. Everytime the person was hit with the reflex tester stick the lines on the montor dipped lower then rised again just to fall again each time she was hit.
